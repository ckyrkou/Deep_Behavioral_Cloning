# Deep_Behavioral_Cloning
Behavioral Cloning — make a car learn to drive by itself!

My attempt at making a vehicle learn to drive like me!

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
- Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
- Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
- Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
- Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
